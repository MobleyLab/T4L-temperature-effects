We provide here the input files and scripts we used to perform BLUES simulations on the apo L99A structure. We describe below the BLUES scripts and the input files used to simulate L99A system. These simulations aimed to enhance the side chain sampling of two residues: Val 111 and Leu 118.

##Manifest
-[`sidechain_cuda.yaml`](sidechain_cuda.yaml): YAML configuration used in these BLUES simulations; it contains all the simulations options used here.
-[`example_sidechain.py`](example_sidechain.py): Script used to run BLUES simulations.
-[`complex.prmtop`](complex.prmtop): AMBER parameter file of the solvated L99A system.
-[`step8.rst7`](step8.rst7): Coordinate file for an equilibrated solvated L99A system; this file was generated by a minimzation followed by an equilibration of L99A (PDB code:4w51) as described in ../../../Classical MD simulations/MD with different FFs/FF14SB/4w51.
