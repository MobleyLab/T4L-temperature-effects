# Classical MD simulations to study the conformational change of L99A upon ligand binding

Here you will find the input files used to perform all MD simulations on T4 lysozyme complexes.

## Manifest

- [`MD on L99A complexes`](MD on L99A complexes): subdirectory containing input files used to perform MD simulations on L99A complexes; the complexes used here were originally downloaded from the Protein Data Bank
- [`MD with 3 loop conformations`](MD with 3 loop conformations): subdirectory containing input files used to carry on MD simulations on L99A complexes using 3 different receptor structures with three different F-helix (loop) conformations 
- [`MD with different FFs`](MD with different FFs): MD simulations on apo L99A using the different conformational states of the F-helix and three variants of the AMBER Force Field
