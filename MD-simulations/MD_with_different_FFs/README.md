 Here you will find all the input files used to run MD simulations on the apo L99A using a combination of three different variants of the AMBER Force Field and the three protein structures with different F-helix conformation.

##Manifest

- [`FF14SB`](FF14SB): contains the files used to run MD simulations on L99A using AMBER force field ff14SB and three different F-helix conformations.
- [`FF15IPQ`](FF15IPQ): contains the files used to run MD simulations on L99A using AMBER force field ff15ipq and three different F-helix conformations.
- [`FB-15`](FB-15): contains the files used to run MD simulations on L99A using AMBER-Force Balance force field (FB-15) and three different F-helix conformations.
