# MD simulations to study the conformational change of L99A upon ligand binding

Here you will find the input files used to perform all MD simulations on T4 lysozyme complexes.

## Manifest

- [`MD_on_L99A_complexes`](MD_on_L99A_complexes): subdirectory containing input files used to perform MD simulations on L99A complexes; the complexes used here were originally downloaded from the Protein Data Bank
- [`MD_with_3_loop_conformations`](MD_with_3_loop_conformations): subdirectory containing input files used to carry on MD simulations on L99A complexes using 3 different receptor structures with three different F-helix (loop) conformations
- [`MD_with_different_FFs`](MD_with_different_FFs): MD simulations on apo L99A using the different conformational states of the F-helix and three variants of the AMBER Force Field
