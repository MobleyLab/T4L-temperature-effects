We used 3 PDB structures of L99A with 3 different conformations of the F-helix: i) a closed F-helix state (PDB code:4w51), ii) an intermediate F-helix state (PDB code: 4w55), and iii) an open F-helix state (PDB code: 4w59). These three receptor structures were prepared using the same protocol described in [`MD_on_L99A_complexes`](../MD_on_L99A_complexes).

Next, we superimposed each of the L99A complexes described and prepared in [`MD_on_L99A_complexes`](../MD_on_L99A_complexes) to each of the three receptors with different F-helix conformation using Chimera. Then, we saved the coordinates of each ligand in the plane of the receptors having different F-helix conformations.

The resulting protein-ligand systems with three different F-helix states can be found here:

- [`4w51`](4w51): Contains the input files used to perform MD simulations on the protein-ligand complexes with a closed F-helix conformation.
- [`4w55`](4w55): Contains the input files used to perform MD simulations on the protein-ligand complexes with an intermediate F-helix conformation.
- [`4w59`](4w59): Contains the input files used to perform MD simulations on the protein-ligand complexes with an open F-helix conformation.
