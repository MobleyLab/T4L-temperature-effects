Here you will find the scripts we used to analyze the results:

- [`Cringer.ipynb`](Cringer.ipynb): the analysis tool used to plot the side-chain rotameric states and the respective frequencies for each residue visited during MD trajectories using a Gaussian kernel-density estimation.

- [`enrichment-AUC-logAUC.ipynb`](enrichment-AUC-logAUC.ipynb): code used to calculate the docking metrics (AUC and logAUC) and plot the respective enrichments plots.
