# Autodock Vina Protocol

Here you will find all the steps and files used to dock T4 compounds into the different apo structures of T4-L99A:

1- We used the best docked poses of the T4 compounds generated by OEdocking as described in [`Docking`](../Docking); the PDB files of these poses docked into the different apo structures of T4-L99A can be found here: [`oedocking-poses`](oedocking-poses)

2- The PDB files of the docked poses were converted to pdbqt using the following command:
mgltools_i86Darwin9_1.5.6/MGLToolsPckgs/AutoDockTools/Utilities24/prepare_ligand4.py -l undockedLigand.pdb

The resulting pdbqt files can be found in: [`poses-pdbqt`](poses-pdbqt)

3- Then, we converted the six protein structures reported in [`files-to-prepare-receptors`](../OEdocking/files-to-prepare-receptors) to pdbqt files using the following command:
mgltools_i86Darwin9_1.5.6/MGLToolsPckgs/AutoDockTools/Utilities24/prepare_receptor4.py -r proteinComplex.pdb

The resulting pdbqt files of the receptors can be found in: [`receptors-and-parameters/receptors`](receptors)

4- The config files containing the parameters used to perform the docking using Autodock Vina are also reported in: [`receptors-and-parameters/configs`](configs)

5- Next, we docked the ligands into the different receptors using:

autodock_vina_1_1_2_mac_catalina_64bit/bin/vina --config config.txt --ligand undockedLigand.pdbqt --out dockedLigand.pdbqt

The generated docked poses are reported in: [`poses-vina-pdbqt`](poses-vina-pdbqt)

6- We converted the files of the docked poses into pdb files:

cut -c-66 dockedLigand.pdbqt > dockedLigand.pdb

All the generated files are reported in: [`poses-vina-pdb`](poses-vina-pdb)

7- In some cases, docking scores for multiple ligands were identical, impairing ranking. So, we reprocessed the scores of the best docking poses using the -score_only flag (for single-point energy calculation on the best docked pose) generating scores with 5 decimals and thus accurate ranks.

autodock_vina_1_1_2_mac_catalina_64bit/bin/vina --config config.txt --ligand dockedLigand.pdbqt --out dockedLigand.pdbqt --score_only > dockedLigandScore.txt

The scores are reported in [`vina-scores`](vina-scores)
