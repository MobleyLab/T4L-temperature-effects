Here you can find the files used to initialize the receptor for docking in the equilibrated RT structure of T4-L99A with an intermediate loop conformation after 50 ns of MD simulations:

- [`rt-intermediate-equilibrated.pdb`](rt-intermediate-equilibrated.pdb): file used to define the receptor for docking with OEdocking. This file was extracted from the MD trajectory corresponding to the MD simulations performed on the rt apo structure of T4-L99A in complex with toluene, after 50 ns of MD. The details of the MD simulations are reported in [`MD-simulations`](../../../MD-simulations/MD_with_3_loop_conformations) and in the Methods sections of the paper and SI.


- [`toluene_oe.mol2`](toluene_oe.mol2): file used to define the reference ligand (Toluene) in order to specify the binding site for docking with OEdocking. The coordinates of toluene were extracted from the original PDB structure (4w53) after aligning 4w53 to the receptor structure: [`rt-intermediate-equilibrated.pdb`](rt-intermediate-equilibrated.pdb). Toluene was considered neutral and was protonated using Chimera 1.12. Then, the PDB file of toluene was converted to a mol2 file using OpenEye toolkits (OpenEye Scientific Software).
