Here you can find the files used to initialize the receptor for docking in the RT structure of T4-L99A with a closed loop conformation:

- [`apoRT_oe.pdb`](apoRT_oe.pdb): file used to define the receptor for docking with OEdocking. To prepare the receptor file, we used pdbfixer to remove the water molecules from the original PDB structure, and to add the missing heavy atoms. Then, we used PDB2PQR server to protonate the resulting PDB structure at pH 7 and to rename the residue/atom according to AMBER naming scheme. Next, we converted the resulting pqr file to a PDB file using Parmed.

- [`toluene_oe.mol2`](toluene_oe.mol2): file used to define the reference ligand (Toluene) in order to specify the binding site for docking with OEdocking. The coordinates of toluene were extracted from the original PDB structure (4w53) after aligning 4w53 to the receptor structure: [`apoRT_oe.pdb`](apoRT_oe.pdb). Toluene was considered neutral and was protonated using Chimera 1.12. Then, the PDB file of toluene was converted to a mol2 file using OpenEye toolkits (OpenEye Scientific Software).
