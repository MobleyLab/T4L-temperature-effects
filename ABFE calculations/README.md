We performed absolute binding free energy simulations on L99A complexed with the following ligands: iodobenzene, toluene, o-xylene, p-xylene, ethylbenzene, propylbenzene, butylbenzene, 3-iodotoluene, 4-iodotoluene and benzylacetate. The protocol used to prepare the PDB structures of the receptors and the mol2 files of the ligands is described for each ligand in the respective subdirectory under ../MD on L99A complexes.

In the following subdirectories, we provide the input files as well as the yaml files used to absolute binding free energy calculations on each of our T4 lysozyme complexes.

-[`toluene`](toluene)
-[`iodobenzene`](iodobenzene)
-[`o-xylene`](o-xylene)
-[`p-xylene`](p-xylene)
-[`ethylbenzene`](ethylbenzene)
-[`propylbenzene`](propylbenzene)
-[`butylbenzene`](butylbenzene)
-[`3-iodotoluene`](3-iodotoluene)
-[`4-iodotoluene`](4iodotoluene)
-[`benzylacetate`](benzylacetate)

PS. We used minimize=yes (yaml files) for the first 500 iterations of each calculation, then minimize=no for the rest of the simulations.
