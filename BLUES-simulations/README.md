This folder contains the input files and scripts we used to carry on BLUES (Binding mode of Ligands Using Enhanced Sampling)  simulations to:

1) Enhance sampling of ligand binding modes: [`Binding-mode_sampling`](Binding-mode_sampling)

2) Enhance the sampling of side chain rotamers in L99A's residues: [`Side-chain_sampling`](Side-chain_sampling)
