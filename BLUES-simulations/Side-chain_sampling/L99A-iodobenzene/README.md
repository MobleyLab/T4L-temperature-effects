We provide here the input files and scripts we used to perform BLUES simulations on the L99A:iodobenzene complex. We describe below the BLUES scripts and the input files used to simulate L99A:iodobenzene complex. These simulations aimed to enhance the side chain sampling of two residues: Val 111 and Leu 118.

##Manifest

- [`sidechain_cuda.yaml`](sidechain_cuda.yaml): YAML configuration used in these BLUES simulations; it contains all the simulations options used here.
- [`example_sidechain.py`](example_sidechain.py): Script used to run BLUES simulations
- [`complex.prmtop`](complex.prmtop): AMBER parameter file of the solvated L99A:iodobenzene complex
- [`step8.rst7`](step8.rst7): Coordinate file for an equilibrated solvated box L99A:iodobenzene system; this file was generated by a minimzation followed by an equilibration of L99A:iodobenzene (PDB code:3dn4) as described in [`Iodobenzene`](../../MD-simulations/MD_on_L99A_complexes/Iodobenzene) and the Methods sections in the paper and SI.
